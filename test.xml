        <type>offerprocess</type>
        <text>If you are rejected, the lender is supposed to provide you with reasons for your denial. One of the most common reasons for a denial is due to the condition of one\'s credit report. Your credit report determines the types of loans and rates you are eligible for, and denials can occur when there are errors with your credit or if it is in poor condition. If a lender denies you due to credit score, you can still seek loans from other lenders</text>

        <text>Discovering your needs and desires in a real estate experience can be difficult, yet also dynamic.

          <name>Inspection</name>
          <type>postprocess</type>
          <text>Lenders require inspections before purchasing a home and these usually occur around 10 days after the offer is accepted. Inspections allow for the buyer to assess the home for any concerns like pests, issues with the structure, electrical issues, mold, or problems with the water pressure. During the inspection, the homebuyer should follow the inspector and take notes of any problems to later get estimates for the issues you find. Sometimes after giving estimates for these issues, the price of the home can be lowered and save the buyer money. Inspections are also the responsibility of the homebuyer to pay for and often the lenders or real estate agents can offer referrals for the buyer.</text>

          <text>Prior to accepting a loan, the homebuyer should make sure that he or she has shopped around for other offers to ensure that they have picked the best fitting loan. Once you have found a loan, some lenders allow you to lock in the loan. Closing on a home can range from 40-65 days, if not longer, and locking in the loan at the right time can save you money if the interests rates increase during the closing period. During the closing period, loan documents will be sent to either the title company or attorney’s office where the closing meeting will take place. At this meeting, you will be required to sign documents to secure the home. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=\&quot;https://lawdecoder.com/housing-closing-documents/\&quot;&gt;Click here for additional details about these documents.&lt;/a&gt;</text>

          <text>Hazard insurance, a coverage within the typical homeowners insurance package, covers possible \&quot;hazards\&quot; like fire damage, hail damage, vandalism, theft, and more. Hazard insurance does not cover damages that arise from guests you allow in your home. Many and most lenders require you to obtain hazard insurance in order to issue you a loan, because only this specific feature of homeowners insurance directly relates to the structure of the home.</text>
