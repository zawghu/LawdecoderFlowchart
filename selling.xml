        <type>preprocess</type>
        <text>Setting a price is one of the most important parts of selling your home. You must be careful not to overprice your home because buyers will lose interest and you will prolong the selling process. It’s better to err on the side of underpricing your home because a low price will attract a lot of offers which will then drive up the price. When deciding on the perfect price of your home, you should research similar, nearby homes (within a half mile) and figure out their original listing price, how much the house sold for, and how long it was on the market. This process is also referred to as Comparative Market Analysis. Make sure you also pay attention to township divisions, property lines, and any other aspects that might affect the price of nearby homes.</text>

        <type>offerprocess</type>
        <text>An Offer to Purchase Real Estate is a legal document that is used by someone who wishes to place a bid on a house or other private residence that is for sale. This document contains information regarding the property like a description of the property, the price that is being offered, the proposed closing/possession date, and other important information the potential buyer wishes to include. This offer becomes a legally binding agreement when it is signed by the buyer and the seller, and when the contained contingencies are met or completed. These offers can be submitted to the seller or the seller’s agent(s).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://lawdecoder.com/contingencies-for-an-offer-to-purchase-real-estate/"&gt;Click here for examples of some of these contingencies!&lt;/a&gt; </text>

        <name>Offer Rejected</name>
        <type>offerprocess</type>
        <text>If you are rejected, the lender is supposed to provide you with reasons for your denial. One of the most common reasons for a denial is due to the condition of one's credit report. Your credit report determines the types of loans and rates you are eligible for, and denials can occur when there are errors with your credit or if it is in poor condition. If a lender denies you due to credit score, you can still seek loans from other lenders. Other common reasons for denial us due to the amount of debt a person owes or their debt-to-income ratio. Things like credit card payments, student loans, and auto payments all could play a part in a denial if these subjects are in poor condition and if these things accumulate more costs than the income you make.</text>

        <name>Counter Offer(s)</name>
        <type>offerprocess</type>
        <text>After submitting an offer, you may receive back a rejection of the offer, an acceptance of the offer, or a counter offer. Although counter offers are referred to differently than an ‘offer’, they are essentially the same concept, except this time the owner of the home is making the prospective buyer an offer to purchase the house with given conditions and price.</text>

        <name>Acceptance of Offer</name>
        <type>offerprocess</type>
        <text> Once the prospective buyer has found a property that they are interested in purchasing, an offer is made to the seller that states the conditions of the buyer. Negotiations often take place during this process and once the two parties are satisfied with the terms, the offer is signed by both parties and the closing process begins. The document being signed is called the “Agreement of Sale” and legally binds the two parties to the conditions.</text>

        <name>Appraisal</name>
        <type>postprocess</type>
        <text>A home appraisal is an unbiased estimate of what the fair market value of your home/property is. During the mortgage loan process, lenders require appraisals to get an idea of what the market value of the home is and if the amount being borrowed is suitable for the property. Appraisals are conducted by trained and licensed professionals that are fair, non-bias, and are trained to give appropriate estimates. Appraisers base the value of the home on its physical characteristics like its age, condition, square footage, the number of rooms/bedrooms, lot size, location and view. Appraisers are not interested in the home’s furniture or things not affixed to the property.</text>

        <name>Inspection</name>
        <type>postprocess</type>
        <text>Lenders require inspections before purchasing a home and these usually occur around 10 days after the offer is accepted. Inspections allow for the buyer to assess the home for any concerns like pests, issues with the structure, electrical issues, mold, or problems with the water pressure. During the inspection, the homebuyer should follow the inspector and take notes of any problems to later get estimates for the issues you find. Sometimes after giving estimates for these issues, the price of the home can be lowered and save the buyer money. Inspections are also the responsibility of the homebuyer to pay for and often the lenders or real estate agents can offer referrals for the buyer.</text>

        <type>postprocess</type>
        <text>This is an agreement between the two parties that officially accepts the buyer’s offer for the property and allows them to progress further in the process. The following tasks must be completed before the official closing date: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complete a home inspection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquire homeowner’s insurance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Order a Termite Clearance Letter (these are no longer required, but are still recommended)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine if you would like a radon inspection and order it from the home inspector&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide your lender with a copy of the contract and discuss locking in your interest rate (Buyer’s usually have 5-days from the date of the contract to apply for the mortgage loan, which is why it’s important to be pre-approved before you start looking for a home)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>

        <name>Hazard Insurance</name>
        <type>postprocess</type>
        <text>Hazard insurance is not a separate policy from homeowners. Hazard insurance covers situations dealing with fire damage, hail damage, theft, vandalism and other issues that relate to the structure of the home. Hazard insurance does not cover injuries that occur on your property to you or a guest. Lenders require some type of insurance policy for the property, and most homeowner policies have hazard insurance included. However, buyers can choose a policy that fits their budget and as a minium, lenders require hazard insurance since it covers the actual property itself.</text>
